# aoc24

[advent of code 24](https://adventofcode.com/2024)

**[Day 1: Historian Hysteria](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1)** - Happy to start this calendar.

**[Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2)** - Same time for first star as yesterday (8s38 vs 8s40), but rank below 2000 (my objective for all *).

**[Day 3: Mull It Over](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/3)** - regexps do all the job.

**[Day 4: Ceres Search](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/4)** - So much time lost in doing complicated and useless things: building a table of horizontal then vertical then diagonal lines (ok I know how to do it now). The second part made me realize I was in the wrong direction. Rewrite the solution afterwards.

**[Day 5: Print Queue](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/5)** - One of the rare occasion to use the `groupby="paragraph"` option of `aoc.Input()`.

**[Day 6: Guard Gallivant](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/6)** - Brute force solution for part two (trying to put an obstacle at every location).
